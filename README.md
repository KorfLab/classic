The KorfLab Classics
====================

Suppose you've got some programming skills and want to practice those in a
bioinformatics setting. What should you do? Learn from the classics! Here are a
bunch of problems that are sort of the sequel to MCB185. If you haven't
completed the MCB185 course, you might want to do that first.

To begin, fork the repo so you can `git push` to your own copy. See the
`REAMDE.md` in each project directory. The suggested order is alphabetical.


- atg - build a pwm and assess its accuracy
- blast - run blast, parse the output, estimate lambda
- cds - translate the longest ORF in an mRNA
- concensus - make an optimal concensus sequence
- dust - mask low complexity sequences
- imeter - re-implement the imeter and historical studies
- sw - write Smith-Waterman and variants
- viterbi - write a Viterbi decoder for hidden Markov models

## Suggestions ##

- You should be able to do these on your own
- Programs should have a proper CLI
- Programs should not have hard-coded paths or values
- Try to limit imports to the essentials
- Follow the style guide
