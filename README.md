Work through these problems to gain expertise in sequence-based bioinformatics.
When you can do these kinds of problems (without the aid of AI), you can call
yourself a bioinformatics programmer.

## Smith-Waterman ##

All aspiring bioinformaticians should be able to write Smith-Waterman from
scratch.

## IMEter ##

The IMEter is a simple kmer-based model applied to A.thaliana intron sequences.
Your task is to rebuild the algorithm and the studies from the early papers.

## PWM ##

Position weight matrices are a simple model for sequences of fixed size. PWMs
are often applied to transcription factor binding sites, and other nucleotide
patterns. Build PWMs for the A. thaliana splice sites.



## Viterbi ##

All aspiring bioinformaticians should write a Viterbi HMM decoder from scratch.
