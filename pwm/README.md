Position Weight Matrix
======================

Position weight matrices are a simple yet useful model for sequences.

Make position weight matrices for the splice donor and acceptor sites. Use the
introns from the `classic/imeter`.

How well do these work? To know that, you have to do some testing and
evaluation. 

Where do you get false examples?
